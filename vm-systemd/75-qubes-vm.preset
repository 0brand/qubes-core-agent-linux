# Units that should not run by default in Qubes VMs.
#
# This file is part of the qubes-core-vm-systemd package.  To ensure that the
# default configuration is applied to all units in the list regardless of
# package installation order, including units added to the list by
# qubes-core-vm-systemd upgrades, all units in the list are preset by a
# scriptlet every time qubes-core-vm-systemd is installed or upgraded.  That
# means that to permanently enable a unit with an [Install] section, you must
# create your own higher-priority preset file.  (It might be possible to be
# smarter and keep a list of units previously preset, but this is not
# implemented.)
#
# For units below with no [Install] section, the scriptlet masks them instead.
# Qubes currently does not provide a way to permanently prevent such units from
# being masked.
